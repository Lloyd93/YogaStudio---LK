# YogaStudio---LK

# This was a course assignment, I had to make a Yoga Studio site.

# Simple layout includes the main page which displays the different available classes with basic information as well as a register button
# which goes to a registration form where people can sign up for a particular class. If the class is full or passed then the button
# changes and can not be clicked.

# The other page is the admin page, with the admin log in button being on the main page. The username and password are both admin.
# Here you can add a new class which goes to a create class form where different information can be inputted etc.
# The new class is added to the main page display as well as the class list on the admins page. The admin can also delete or mark a class # as full. Deleting or adding a class is reflected in the database as well. There is also an admin log out button on the admin page.

# The database is called yoga and the yoga.sql file is the database. In phpmyadmin create a new database called 'yoga' and then import
# this sql file into it and the database will function as designed.


# Quick Info:
# Username: admin Password: admin Database Name: yoga
